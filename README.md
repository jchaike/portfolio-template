## What the heck, EJS?

Yes, it is 2021 and I chose to use EJS. Why?

It's dead simple. It really comes down to that. Handing this off to someone that wants to maybe make some visual modifications, but not get too deep into the weeds of things, with the ability to simply put variables into a `.json` file just can't be beat.

## Ok, sure, I'm sold.. how do I use it?

Like I said - dead simple!

To run locally:

```
npm run dev
```

To deploy to heroku:

```
npm run build
```
